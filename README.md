# Skin-Cancer-Classification-with-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-XAI
### Overview
This project presents an automated skin cancer classification system leveraging Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Explainable AI (XAI). The model classifies skin lesions into seven categories, including melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, using the HAM10000 dataset. To enhance interpretability, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is integrated, providing visual insights into the modelâ€™s decision-making process.

#### Key Features
* Deep Learning-based Skin Cancer Classification using ResNet-50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.
* Custom CNN Model designed to improve classification accuracy.
* Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME, offering interpretable predictions.
* Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1-Score.
#### Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset, which contains 10,015 labeled skin lesion images.

#### Results
The proposed Deep CNN model outperforms pre-trained models, achieving a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 95.23%. The LIME-based XAI approach provides insights into model decisions, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in AI-driven dermatological diagnosis.
